    <header>MY FIRST WEBPAGE</header>
    <h1>Welcome to my first attempt at making a webpage.</h1>
    <h2>This is a subheading.</h2>
    <main>
         <p>This is a paragraph. While simply text, this is only the beginning of a longer item. As I keep typing, I don't know how long the text can go before it wraps here.
            This is a new line that I manually (/n) added. The text continues. I can keep typing and use the enter key to keep the text inside my editor window, but it will display as a block of text on the page. <i>Word Wrap</i> Also, head on down to the <a href="#links-header">Links section</a> below!
        </p>

        <h3>Another subheading, a picture</h3>
        <img src="images/harperdog.jpg" alt="Dog looks like Harper">

        <p>Continuing along, there is plenty to think about as I craft more of this page.
            The text elements are coming along nicely. The elements update because the text editor creates the close element item tab thing. <a href="http://www.panthers.com">Here</a> is a link to the Panthers webpage.

            Also, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sporcle.com">let's try Sporcle</a> as a nice diversion from working so much.
        </p>

        <p>This <a href="#">link</a> is dead, so I can make it go somewhere later.</p>
        
        <h3> Another picture, this time as a link!</h3>
        <p><a href="#"><img src="images/tree.jpg" alt="A tree."></a></p>
        <h4 id="links-header">Links to stuff I enjoy</h4>
